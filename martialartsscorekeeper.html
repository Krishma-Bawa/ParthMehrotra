			<h1>Martial Arts Score Keeper - Android App</h1>
		</div>
		<h2>October 1, 2009 - January 1, 2010</h2>
		<p>Simple Android app that replaces the traditional scoring technologies that cost thousands of dollars and are not accessible to all schools.</p>
		<p>This was my first project on the Android Platform. Using resources such as Google's <a href="">FIX THIS LINK</a>, <a href="">Another link</a>, and <a href="">Another link</a> I taught myself everything I would need to know to begin Android Developement.</p>
		<p>Due to the simplicity of this app, I have intensions to update it, and open-source.</p>
