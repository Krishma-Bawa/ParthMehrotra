		</div>
		<h2>October 1, 2009 - January 1, 2010</h2>
		<p>Simple Android app that replaces the traditional scoring technologies that cost thousands of dollars and are not accessible to all schools.</p>
		<p>This was my first project on the Android Platform. Using resources such as Google's <a href="http://developer.android.com/index.html">Developer Documentation</a>, <a href="http://www.vogella.com/">Vogella</a>, and <a href="http://marakana.com/">Marakana</a> I taught myself everything I would need to know to begin Android Developement.</p>

		<p>You can check out the app on the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Parth">Play Store</a>.</p>
