		<p>Skylight1 is an open source Java mobile projects framework and collection of Android applications and demos. This group started in Feb 2009 as part of the NYCJava Java User Group with the revenue from the project's initial applications going to the NYPC Users Group, a 501c3 educational non-profit.</p>
		<p>I joined Skylight1 in the winter of 2012. Being an active member at Skylight1 has taught me a lot about best practices in Android and Open-Source. While on Skylight1, I've had the opportunity to collaborate with members on projects that utilize Android, Google Glass, and Google Wear technologies.</p>
