			<h1>Internship at Plexx</h1>
		</div>
		<h2>July 1, 2013 - June 1, 2014</h2>
		<p>Plexx is a company dedicated to helping unemployed and underemployed people find jobs. While I was working at Plexx I worked on an Android app, and contributed to a website that helped undemployed people and underemployed people find the nearest career center, pick a field they are interested, and receive training specific to that field. Plexx alowed career centers to monitor all the people they are trying to help, and contact them if the need arises.<p/>
		<p>During my work at Plexx I contributed to an Android App and Website that interfaced with Amazon Web Services and Parse. I also had the opportunity to goto career centers, and interview people seeking jobs in order to improve the user experience. We held many focus groups to understand the unique needs of the demographic we were targeting.</p>
